## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines
- Follow C# naming conventions and coding standards
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods focused and reasonably sized
- Add comments for complex logic

### XML Documentation
- All public APIs must have XML documentation comments
- Use `<summary>`, `<param>`, `<returns>`, and `<exception>` tags appropriately
- Include code examples in `<example>` tags where helpful

Example:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Processes the specified data.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="data">The input data to process.</param>
/// <param name="options">Optional processing parameters.</param>
/// <returns>The processed result.</returns>
/// <exception cref="ArgumentNullException">Thrown when data is null.</exception>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// var result = processor.Process(inputData, new ProcessingOptions());
/// </code>
/// </example>
public ProcessResult Process(InputData data, ProcessingOptions options = null)
```
